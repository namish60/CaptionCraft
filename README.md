# CaptionCraft
This project creates captions for images using AI. It uses a deep learning model trained on image-caption pairs.

Image Features: InceptionV3 extracts important details from the image.

Caption Processing: Captions are read from captions.txt, broken into words, and converted into numbers for training.

Text Generation: An LSTM-based decoder creates meaningful captions based on the image features.
